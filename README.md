<h1>Nutritional counselling Lucie 🍏</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>
Nutriční poradenství Lucie is a project I developed for my mother. It serves as her personal website for providing nutrition advice and services. Originally conceived as an e-commerce platform, we decided to focus on the informational aspect instead. As a nutrition consultant, my mother wanted to have her own web presence to reach potential clients.

<h2>Tech Stack 🛠️</h2>
<ul>
<li>React: For building the frontend.
</li>
<li>Stripe: Integrated for handling payments (originally planned for the e-commerce functionality).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features 🌟</h2>
<ul>
<li>Static Web Pages: The website provides information about nutrition services, consultation, and expertise.</li>
<li>Responsive Design: The pages are designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Process 🚀</h2>
Nutriční poradenství Lucie started with the goal of creating a professional website for my mother’s nutrition consulting services. We began by designing wireframes and then proceeded to implement the design using React. Although we initially planned to include e-commerce features (using Stripe for payments), we decided to focus on the informational aspect due to practical considerations.
